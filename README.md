# JAVA_AGH_COURSE
Code from 'Java programming' subject at 5th term of AGH Data Science studies
This repository contains several **Java-based applications** showcasing different programming techniques and **JavaFX** features. The projects include mathematical visualization, simple physics-based animations, polymorphism in graphical applications, and interactive maps.

## Projects Included

### 1. Quadratic Equation Visualizer
- A JavaFX application that calculates and **visualizes** quadratic functions.
- **Features:** Dynamic graph updates, real-time equation solving, and user input for coefficients.

### 2. Volleyball Simulation
- A simple physics-based game where a **ball is thrown** across a volleyball court.
- **Features:** Gravity simulation, user-controlled launch angle and speed, and animation.

### 3. Polymorphism Shapes Game
- Demonstrates **polymorphism** through interactive shapes appearing in **different colors and sizes**.
- **Features:** Shape resizing, dynamic object creation, and JavaFX rendering.

### 4. Geographical Map Visualization
- A program that displays a **map with various terrains** such as forests, mountains, and rivers.
- **Features:** Interactive UI, location-based visualization, and **customizable markers**.
